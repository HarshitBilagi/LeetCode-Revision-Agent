## LeetCode Daily Revision Agent

This project is a fully automated Python bot that emails you **2 unsent LeetCode problems every day**, using your last 20 solved problems pulled from a public API. You get problem titles, solution links, and basic info delivered to your inbox each morning. No manual selection, no promptsâ€”just consistent revision!

- **Remembers sent problems** (local file, no repeats)
