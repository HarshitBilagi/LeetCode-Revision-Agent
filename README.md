## LeetCode Daily Revision Agent

This project is a fully automated Python bot that emails you **2 unsent LeetCode problems every day**, using your last 20 solved problems pulled from a public API: https://github.com/alfaarghya/alfa-leetcode-api. You get problem titles, solution links, and basic info delivered to your inbox each morning. No manual selection, no promptsâ€”just consistent revision!
